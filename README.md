# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning ü©∫‚ù§Ô∏è

## ‚óªÔ∏è Project Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various health metrics. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## ‚óªÔ∏è Objectives

- To analyze and preprocess the heart disease dataset.
- To visualize the data and understand the relationships between features.
- To build and train a machine learning model to predict heart disease.
- To evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## ‚óªÔ∏è Methodologies

### 1. Data Handling

- **Libraries Used**: NumPy, pandas
- **Tasks**: Importing and handling the dataset, checking for missing values, and basic data exploration.

### 2. Data Visualization

- **Libraries Used**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tasks**: Visualizing the distributions of numerical features, analyzing categorical features, and identifying correlations between features.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

- **Libraries Used**: Scikit-learn
- **Tasks**: Standardizing numerical features to ensure uniformity and handling outliers.

### 4. Model Training

- **Libraries Used**: Scikit-learn
- **Tasks**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, training a Logistic Regression model.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- **Libraries Used**: Scikit-learn
- **Tasks**: Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ‚óªÔ∏è Technical Skills 

- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and transforming features to improve model performance.
- **Model Tuning**: Adjusting model parameters to enhance accuracy and reliability.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using various metrics to assess the model's performance and ensure its effectiveness.

##  ‚óªÔ∏è Results üí°

The final model demonstrated good performance in predicting heart disease. Key insights from the EDA and the model's evaluation metrics indicate that features such as cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate achieved, and age are significant predictors of heart disease.

## ‚óªÔ∏è Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation in developing a robust machine learning model for heart disease prediction. The insights gained from the EDA were crucial in guiding the feature engineering and model building steps.
